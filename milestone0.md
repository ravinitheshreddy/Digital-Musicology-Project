### Tonality related research questions

The phenomenon of tonality is one of the vastest topic in the field of music theory and many Western musicologists consider it as the principal theoretical foundation in Western music. The definition of tonality is however itself not well defined, and while some theorists argue it is restrained to the Western major and minor scale systems, others pledge for a more embracing definition that englobes systems of different cultures. These observations lead to a couple of interesting questions related to tonality both in the Western music history and cross-culturally. First, using the narrow definition, as the tonality in Western music includes a multitude of musical concepts such as cadence, modulation, harmony, closure and chords, it would be interesting to analyze how they evolved over different periods of music history and how different composers appropriated them. Secondly, using the broader definition, it would be interesting to analyze how concepts that can be applied to different cultures, such as mode, tonic, and interval, compare cross-culturally.

### Non-tonality related questions

Music is part of daily life for many of us and we hear the music of different genres from their own culture and other cultures. Such continuous listening will make us associate certain sounds to particular genre/culture. Later, when we hear a new song, we associate it with a genre and culture. Nevertheless, we cannot explicitly explain to others the procedure we follow in assigning a genre and culture to the music. We envisage that a set of notes in a piece of music would represent the genre of it. Hence, in this project, we would like to analyze the music from different genres to find out which are the notes that distinguish them? Specifically, 1) are there any preferred notes or important notes for each genre/style? and 2) Are there any representative melodies of each genre/style? Due to the long tradition of music that spans hundreds of centuries, the performers might have changed the way certain pieces are played. This will bring us to the second thought of looking at a genre. How did the note's usage change in the same genre?

This can be extended to see similar representative notes of individual artists as well.
