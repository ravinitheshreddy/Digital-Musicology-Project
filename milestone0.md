### Tonality related research questions

The phenomenon of tonality is one of the vastest topic in the field of music theory and many Western musicologists consider it to be the principal theoretical foundation in Western music. However, the definition of tonality itself is disputed. While it is established that tonality denotes the organization of music compositions around a tonic, some theorists argue it is restrained to the Western major and minor scale systems, and others pledge for a more embracing definition that encompasses systems of different cultures. This disagreement takes root in part because this _organization of music_ generally includes music concepts that are specific to Western music, such as cadence, counterpoint, or modulation. Other concepts however can be applied to modal pieces of any culture, like for example the scale degrees or intervals.

Therefore, this project will endeavour to provide some insights on the cross-culturality of tonality by statistically analyzing modal music from different cultures. More specifically, we will first study how different music concepts interfere with tonality in each examined culture. Afterwards, we will evaluate how each of these concepts, if applicable, compare cross-culturally in order to establish a possible answer as to whether it is relevant to expand the concept of tonality to non-Western scale systems.

As we will notably evaluate the distribution of scale degrees, one possible outcome might be that we observe that the perfect fifth above the tonic is prevalent in non-Western scale systems, thus showing a cross-cultural similarity in the way to express tonality. However, we may also expect to find out that the Western dominant scale degree is infrequent in other scale-systems, thus hinting at a different expression of tonality.

### Non-tonality related research questions (old ?)

Music is part of daily life for many of us and we hear the music of different genres from their own culture and other cultures. Such continuous listening will make us associate certain sounds to particular genre/culture. Later, when we hear a new song, we associate it with a genre and culture. Nevertheless, we cannot explicitly explain to others the procedure we follow in assigning a genre and culture to the music. We envisage that a set of notes in a piece of music would represent the genre of it. Hence, in this project, we would like to analyze the music from different genres to find out which are the notes that distinguish them? Specifically, 1) are there any preferred notes or important notes for each genre/style? and 2) Are there any representative melodies of each genre/style? Due to the long tradition of music that spans hundreds of centuries, the performers might have changed the way certain pieces are played. This will bring us to the second thought of looking at a genre. How did the note's usage change in the same genre?

This can be extended to see similar representative notes of individual artists as well.

## Concepts and Data

    1. What is the concrete focus of your project?
    2. Which musically relevant concepts do you use or study?
    3. How can they be operationalized?
    4. Which datasets can help you answer your research question?
    5. Do they already exist or do you need to create / transform them?

## Methods

    1. Which methods are you planning to use?
    2. How are they related to the research question?

The main method we plan to use is the statistical analysis of the scale degrees in line with procedures presented in the class and Moss et al. (2019). As western music was analyzed using these methods, we like to continue using it to have the same ground when we compare the results. If time permits, later we would like to analyze the pieces as networks with notes as the nodes to examine the scale degree transitions.

## Literature

    1. What is the state-of-the-art in relation to your question Name at least 3 relevant publications.
    2. Which issues are not yet addressed that your project supplements?

The basic concepts summarizing the early studies on tonality, more specific analysis on scale tone, are presented in chapter 9 of Huron (2006). This will serve as a reference baseline for our study. More recently, Moss et al. (2019) have performed a corpus study of Beethoven's string quartets to obtain the statistical characteristics of tonal harmony. This recent study would provide us with the characterization of western music.

In the above-mentioned studies, the research has been centered around western music and we plan to extend these statistical analyses to non-Western music.

## Two more things

    1. For which part of your project do you need input and/or support from our side?
    2. You could already have a look into datasets suitable for you project

We would like to have the support of the teaching team in the following aspects:

1. Primarily, we would like to know if our research question is grounded or not?
2. Does the DCML lab already have any tonal annotated datasets or other datasets that could be beneficial to us?

Regarding the datasets, by the time of submission, we were not able to find symbolic music datasets outside western music that are annotated with tonic. Thus, we would require help from you in this regard as well.
