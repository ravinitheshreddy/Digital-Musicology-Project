Music is part of daily life for many of us and we hear the music of different genres from their own culture and other cultures. Such continuous listening will make us associate certain sounds to particular genre/culture. Later, when we hear a new song, we associate it with a genre and culture. Nevertheless, we cannot explicitly explain to others the procedure we follow in assigning a genre and culture to the music. We envisage that a set of notes in a piece of music would represent the genre of it. Hence, in this project, we would like to analyze the music from different genres to find out which are the notes that distinguish them? Specifically, 1) are there any preferred notes or important notes for each genre/style? and 2) Are there any representative melodies of each genre/style? Due to the long tradition of music that spans hundreds of centuries, the performers might have changed the way certain pieces are played. This will bring us to the second thought of looking at a genre. How did the note's usage change in the same genre?

This can be extended to see similar representative notes of individual artists as well.
