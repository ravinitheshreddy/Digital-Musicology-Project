### Tonality related research questions

The phenomenon of tonality is one of the vastest topic in the field of music theory and many Western musicologists consider it as the principal theoretical foundation in Western music. However, the definition of tonality itself is disputed. While it is established that tonality denotes the organization of music compositions around a tonic, some theorists argue it is restrained to the Western major and minor scale systems, and others pledge for a more embracing definition that encompasses systems of different cultures. This disagreement takes root in part in the fact that this *organization of music* can encompass many musical concepts; some of which are not shared cross-culturally. Some concepts however can be applied to any modal piece of any culture, like for example the usage of scale degrees relatively to the tonic.

Therefore, this project will endeavour to provide some insights on the cross-culturality of tonality by statistically analyzing modal music from different cultures. More specifically, we will first study how different music concepts interfere with tonality in each examined culture. Afterwards, we will evaluate how each of these concepts, if applicable, compare cross-culturally in order to establish a possible answer as to whether the tonality is expressed similarly around the globe or if there are significant differences.

As a couple of concepts that we will evaluate are the distribution of scale degrees relative to the tonic and their transitions, one possible outcome might be that we observe that the fifth above the tonic is dominant in all studied cultures, thus showing a cross-cultural similarity in the way to express tonality, but that we also note that this fifth is most often followed by a descending second in Western music, while it may be followed most often by a descending third in another culture, thus showing cultural differences.

### Non-tonality related research questions (old ?)

Music is part of daily life for many of us and we hear the music of different genres from their own culture and other cultures. Such continuous listening will make us associate certain sounds to particular genre/culture. Later, when we hear a new song, we associate it with a genre and culture. Nevertheless, we cannot explicitly explain to others the procedure we follow in assigning a genre and culture to the music. We envisage that a set of notes in a piece of music would represent the genre of it. Hence, in this project, we would like to analyze the music from different genres to find out which are the notes that distinguish them? Specifically, 1) are there any preferred notes or important notes for each genre/style? and 2) Are there any representative melodies of each genre/style? Due to the long tradition of music that spans hundreds of centuries, the performers might have changed the way certain pieces are played. This will bring us to the second thought of looking at a genre. How did the note's usage change in the same genre?

This can be extended to see similar representative notes of individual artists as well.
