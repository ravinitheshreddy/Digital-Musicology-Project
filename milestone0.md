## Tonality in non-Western music

## Research Questions

The phenomenon of tonality is one of the vastest topics in the field of music theory and many Western musicologists consider it to be the principal theoretical foundation in Western music. However, the definition of tonality itself is disputed. While it is established that tonality denotes the organization of music compositions around a tonic, some theorists argue it is restrained to the Western major and minor scale systems, and others pledge for a more embracing definition that encompasses systems of different cultures.

Therefore, this project will endeavor to provide some insights on the cross-culturality of tonality by statistically analyzing modal music from different cultures. More specifically, we will first study how musical concepts that are universal to modal music interfere with tonality in each examined culture. Afterward, we will evaluate how each of these concepts compares cross-culturally in order to establish whether or not tonality is express similarly in different cultures.

As we will notably evaluate the distribution of scale degrees, one possible outcome might be that we observe that the perfect fifth above the tonic is also prevalent in non-Western scale systems, thus showing a cross-cultural similarity in the way to express tonality. However, we may also expect to find out that the Western dominant scale degree is infrequent in other scale-systems, thus hinting at a different expression of tonality.

## Concepts and Data

In this project, we will compare the modal organization of one or two corpora of non-Western modal pieces with Western ones. This comparison will revolve around the central musical concept of tonality, which, for the scope of this project, we will understand in its broad meaning, i.e., the organization of compositions around a central pitch. To evaluate this organization, we will be careful to not apply concepts of Western music that do not relate to other cultures. Therefore, we will focus on concepts that are inherently shared cross-culturally in modal pieces. We will mainly focus on the use of scale degrees in each corpus by translating each tonic to a reference pitch. We will then be able to learn the properties of modal music organization in each examined culture by analyzing their frequency as well as their transitions. This analysis will then lead to a comparison which will allow us to state whether or not there is a similar expression of tonality in different cultures.

To conduct this analysis, we will need one or two datasets of non-Western modal pieces in symbolic format. Moreover, each piece would need to be labeled with its tonic. We were thinking of choosing Indian and/or Chinese music. However, we have been unable so far to find such labeled datasets in symbolic format. If they do not exist, we may need to annotate the tonic ourselves or to infer it.

## Methods

As stated above, all of our methods will rotate around the use of scale degrees. First, we will conduct statistical analyses of their distribution. We will also analyze how each scale degree transitions to another. This will allow us to build a graph or a table depicting the most likely transitions and to compute a notion of entropy. The results of these analyses will allow us to interpret the modal organization in each culture. Moreover, comparing them will offer a cross-cultural perspective on tonality.

## Literature

The basic concepts summarizing the early studies on tonality, more specifically the analysis of the major mode, are presented in chapter 9 of Huron (2006). This will serve as a reference baseline for our study. More recently, Moss et al. (2019a) have performed a corpus study of Beethoven's string quartets to obtain the statistical characteristics of tonal harmony. This recent study would provide us with the characterization of Western music. Similarly, chapters 9-12 in Moss (2019b) discuss the tonal relations that can be inferred from a large historical corpus of western music.

In these studies, the research was restrained to Western music. As Huron states, no such analysis has been performed for non-Western pieces, and our project will strive to fill this void.

## Two more things

We would like to have the support of the teaching team for the following aspects:

1. We would like to know if there would be any other relevant musical concept that would help us comparing the tonality in different cultures.
2. As stated above, we have not found our dataset(s) yet. For this reason, we would like to know if the DCML already knows of any non-Western modal music dataset labeled with the tonic that could be beneficial to us?
