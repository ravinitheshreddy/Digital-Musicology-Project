## Modal organisation in non-Western music

## Research Questions

The phenomenon of tonality is one of the vastest topics in the field of music theory and many Western musicologists consider it to be the principal theoretical foundation in Western music<sup>1</sup>. However, the definition of tonality itself is disputed. Some music theorists argue it is restrained to the Western major and minor scale systems, and others pledge for a more embracing definition that encompasses systems of different cultures<sup>1</sup>. For the scope of this project we will understand the tonality in its simplest meaning as "a system for interpreting pitches or chords through their relationship to a reference pitch"<sup>1</sup>. While many analysis of such relationships to the tonic have been performed in Western music, this territory remains vastly unexplored in non-Western cultures<sup>1</sup>.

Therefore, this project will delve into this area and will strive to answer how is the modal organisation structured in another culture, namely the .... (Indian, chinese, other ?) and how does it compare with the Western one ? *insert justification about this culture, mainly it needs to have 12 pitches to be comparable*.

The results of this study will likely show whether there is a significant difference between Western and *insert culture* music in the use of scale degrees and pitch transitions.

------------------------------------------Chinese folk songs

Chinese folk song is a kind of Chinese folk music genre, a song art produced and developed by the people through extensive oral singing in their daily life. Because the production is closely related to the lives of the people, influenced by the geographical conditions, customs and production methods of different regions, Chinese folk songs present diverse stylistic characteristics. For instance, in the Northwest Plateau, due to the inconvenient transportation, folk songs are usually sung in the fields during or after work. Singing folk songs sometimes also becomes a way of socializing for the locals; in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Plains, the culture is more developed and the people’s lives are more prosperous. The local folk songs are dominated by minor tunes, with a soft and gentle style; in the Northeast Plain, due to the unrestrained folk customs, besides the minor tune, there are also local characteristics like Yangko and chants; in the southeast of Guangxi and parts of Hainan, the majority of fishermen used to be an important social class in the area, so the local folk songs are most prominent in fishermen's songs.

Based on the background above, our research question is: Taking Chinese folk songs from the three regions of han, natmin, and shanxi as examples, can we find the differences in melody and tonality? Can we give corresponding descriptions of folk songs in these three regions to analyze their genres? Currently there is no statistical analysis and research on Chinese folk songs, so we hope to make preliminary explorations in this field.

In addition, the Chinese folk songs studied in this project are those compiled and published after the founding of New China in 1949. (Most of the ancient Chinese folk song scores are no longer available. On the one hand, ancient folk songs have always been sung orally. On the other hand, even with the notation, the working people in the past would not use it. It was not until the end of the 19th century that folklorists started to record folk songs with gong-rule scores. Therefore, the comprehensive and planned collection, sorting, recording, and publication of folk songs can only become a reality in New China.)

## Concepts and Data

In this project, we will analyze the modal organization of a corpus of *insert culture* music. To do so, the most important and central music concept we will use is the scale degree. Indeed, by translating each composition to a reference pitch relatively to their tonic, the scale degree will provide a common factor to analyze them all together. More precisely, we will measure the distribution of their use as well as the transitions between one another. Such an analysis will provide us a characterization of the modal organisation of *insert culture*. We will then repeat the same computations with a monophonic corpus of Western music and compare the two organisations.


To conduct this analysis, we will need a dataset of *insert culture*. In this dataset, each piece would need to be labeled with its tonic. *insert paragraph about the dataset we are thinking of using*. Moreover we will need a similar dataset of monophonic Western music such as *insert what we've found*
## Methods

As stated above, all of our methods will rotate around the use of scale degrees. First, we will conduct statistical analyses of their distribution in order to determine which scale degrees are the most prevalent. We will also analyze how each scale degree transitions to another. This will allow us to build a graph or a table depicting the most likely transitions and to compute a notion of entropy<sup>1</sup>. The results of these analyses will allow us to interpret the modal organization in both *insert culture* music and *insert type of Western music* which will lead to a comparison of both systems.

## Literature

The basic concepts summarizing the early studies on tonality, more specifically the analysis of the major mode, are presented in chapter 9 of Huron (2006). This will serve as a reference baseline for our study. More recently, Moss et al. (2019a) have performed a corpus study of Beethoven's string quartets to obtain the statistical characteristics of tonal harmony. This recent study would provide us with the characterization of Western music. Similarly, chapters 9-12 in Moss (2019b) discuss the tonal relations that can be inferred from a large historical corpus of western music.

In these studies, the research was restrained to Western music. As Huron states, no such analysis has been performed for non-Western pieces, and our project will strive to fill this void.
