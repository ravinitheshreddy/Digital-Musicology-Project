    "The graphs and heatmaps above reveal both similarities and differences in the pitches transitions across the different regions. For instance, we can observe that in all regions, Bs and Gs are most often followed by an A. However, it also appears that while some regions make frequent use of consecutive As (e.g. Central and Southwest), others barely use that transition (e.g. Northwest and Neimeng). From the map provided in section 2.1, we can see that these regions sharing similarities also share borders. It also provides us with evidence the interval of transition is visibly different for each region. \n",

Additionally, the heatmaps indicate to us that the interval between the pitches could also be an indicator of the music belonging to a region. Thus, in the next step, we shall look at intervals of transitions between the pitches in pieces belonging to each division to extract preferred intervals of songs for each division.\n",

    "## 4. Conclusion\n",
    "At the end of this explorative data analysis, we observe that only a few of the comparing methods we used show significant differences across the eight regions of China we defined. Only the pitch transitions provide some insight on this matter. However, there is still more analysis that we haven't performed now and that may reveal regional characteristics. For example, we have only plotted the pitch transitions but have not done it for the scale degrees. Moreover, while we have currently only computed the distribution of scale degrees by counting them, we will also take into account its duration and beat strength in the next milestone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, while our first results tend to refute our initial hypothesis, we hope that applying other methods and analyzing the results more precisely will bring more evidence of regional differences in the organization of CFS."
